# Retail Performance Dashboard

Leveraging a 3-years worth of Sales data, I've created a simple performance Dashboard (SQL Server &amp; PowerBI)

In this use case, Iâ€™ve received three (3) flat files (Sales from 2020 to 2022) with raw data for Sales transactions from a Retail brand with both brick & mortar and online presence. 
First step was to create one unique flat file from the three files and upload it to a SQL Server instance.
Once in SQL Server, I proceeded to normalize the dataset, by creating multiple tables:
1.	Customers
2.	Products
3.	Transactions
4.	Orders

I also created some tables to develop a RFM model (Recency, Frequency and Monetary value)
1.	Customers_RFM
2.	RFM
3.	RFM_Scoring
